Super simple hello world example. 

Helpful links. 

I found a link from Google that has a hello world example utilizing a Python app stored in the cloud
Here it is: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/quickstart

However, this example does use Google's App Engine (https://cloud.google.com/appengine/), and I'm not sure if we should be focusing on this or seeing how much we can do within Google Colaboratory
