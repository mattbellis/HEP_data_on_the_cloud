How do we do this? 

Helpful links? 

Basic example?

Example with larger amount of data. 

How do we check that the data is uploaded?

Some helpful guides from our pals at Google:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdRuDaDyyBo A video from Google Cloud Platform about uploading files and folders to the Cloud
https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/uploading-objects A written tutorial about the above
https://cloud.google.com/solutions/transferring-big-data-sets-to-gcp Guide for large data sets (probably what we need for BaBar)

The hello world example from HOW_DO_WE_RUN_ON_GC_ENGINE (linked here: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/quickstart) is probably a basic example, even if it uses the App Engine. It shouldn't be too hard to adapt it for data sets

Here's how to make the data public.

Had to use the Legacy options for Legacy Object Reader
