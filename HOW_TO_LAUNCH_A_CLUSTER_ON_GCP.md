How do we do this? 

Helpful links. 


From our good friend Google: 
https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/create-cluster for creating a cluster
https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/manage-cluster for managing said cluster

# Will have to ssh in to a VM

https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux

Need to learn this first. I need to make sure I'm very careful about the options.
