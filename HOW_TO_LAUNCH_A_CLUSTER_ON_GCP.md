How do we do this? 

Helpful links. 


From our good friend Google: 
https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/create-cluster for creating a cluster
https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/docs/guides/manage-cluster for managing said cluster

I think these are the instructions on how to launch an HTCondor instance.

# Will have to ssh in to a VM

Make sure you follow this closely. If it works, you have a window that pops up thatI think
is already ssh'ed into the instance. 

Might want to look at [this](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/transfer-files) to see how to transfer
files into the instance.
